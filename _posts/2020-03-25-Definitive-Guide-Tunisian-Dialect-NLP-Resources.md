## Introduction

The Tunisian dialect is an under-resourced language. This project is a personal effort to put scattered sources of information, 
resources, and tools related to automated processing of text written in the Tunisian dialect in one place for all to use. 

Hopefully it will save NLP practitioners valuable time spent otherwise chasing after information scattered all over the Web.

I have categorized this information into the following categories:

1. Publicly Available Corpora and Lexicons
2. NLP Software
3. Scientific Publications
4. Web Articles & Links
5. Academic research groups & labs
6. Conferences & Workshops

## Publicly Available Corpora and Lexicons

- The MADAR Arabic Dialect Corpus and Lexicon, H. Bouamor et al., http://nlp.qatar.cmu.edu/madar/

Description:
    "The latest version of the lexicon is available for browsing online."


- CODA Seed Lexicon, https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/coda/dialect-specific


- Tunisian Arabic Corpus, by Karen McNeil and Miled Faiza, http://www.tunisiya.org

	2) new written sources (blogs, email, Facebook, forum postings) -- currently the dominant source
	3) transcribed audio (e.g. from radio programming)."
	"The corpus is available freely online at tunisiya.org, where users can perform complex concordance 
	searches and view search results in context, with access to the full text. "

https://github.com/drelhaj/ArabicDialects/tree/master/ArabicSharedTask

Description: 
 -- dataset used in the paper "Arabic Dialect Identification in the Context of Bivalency and Code-Switching", by M. El-Haj, P. Rayson, and M. Aboelezz, LREC 2018.
 -- combines data from AOC corpus (Omar Zaidan) and tunisiya.org, both referenced in this section.

- AOC: Arabic online commentary dataset by Omar Zaidan, last updated August 2012, https://github.com/sjeblee/AOC

Description:
  "The AOC dataset was created by crawling the websites of three Arabic newspapers,
  and extracting online articles and readers' comments.  The readers' comments are
  arguably more "interesting", which is why we call this the *commentary* dataset,
  but the articles themselves are also included."

- TSAC: Tunisian sentiment analysis corpus, https://github.com/fbougares/TSAC

Description:
  "About 17k user comments manually annotated to positive and negative polarities. 
  This corpus is collected from Facebook users comments written on official pages 
  of Tunisian radios and TV channels namely Mosaique FM, JawhraFM, Shemes FM, 
  HiwarElttounsi TV and Nessma TV. The corpus is collected from a period spanning 
  January 2015 until June 2016."


## NLP Software

### Open-source

- FARASA toolkit, http://qatsdemo.cloudapp.net/farasa/

Description:
  "Farasa (which means “insight” in Arabic), is a fast and accurate text processing toolkit for Arabic text. 
  Farasa consists of the segmentation/tokenization module, POS tagger, Arabic text Diacritizer, and Dependency Parser. 
  We measure the performance of the segmenter in terms of accuracy and efficiency, in two NLP tasks, namely Machine Translation (MT) 
  and Information Retrieval (IR). Farasa outperforms or equalizes state-of-the-art Arabic segmenters (Stanford and MADAMIRA), 
  while being more than one order of magnitude faster."

### Free online demo-only tools

- ADIDA: Automatic Dialect Identification for Arabic, https://adida.abudhabi.nyu.edu/

Description:
 "This interface is a demo of the MADAR project dialect identification system developed by Salameh, Bouamor and Habash (2018).
  The system is able to distinguish amongst 25 cities (from Rabat to Muscat) in addition to Modern Standard Arabic.
  To use the demo enter text in Standard or Dialectal Arabic. The cities and regions that our system identifies will be lit up.
  The ADIDA web interface is described in the paper by Obeid, Salameh, Bouamor and Habash (2019). "

In The 4th International Conference on Arabic Computational Linguistics (ACLing 2018), 2018.
Abstract: This paper presents a critical description of natural language processing for Tunisian Arabic. Indeed, several linguistic resources
   were proposed for the three types of Tunisian Arabic (intellectualized dialect, spontaneous dialect and electronic dialect). We
   present different linguistic resources (corpora, lexicons and linguistic analysis tools). This study can be used as a quick reference
   for the scientific community working on natural language processing in general and more precisely those studying Tunisian Arabic.

Abstract: The language study and automatic processing require the availability of large raw and annotated corpora. 
   Collecting data and constructing such language resources are non-trivial tasks in the NLP field, especially when it 
   comes to deal with low-resource languages. In this paper, we are concerned with the Tunisian dialect (TD) and propose 
   to survey the availability of corpora for its automatic processing. From the study of the main works that have been 
   carried out in TD language processing, we were able to identify and categorize the different types of corpora that were 
   constructed as part of these works. We present, in this paper, a summary of the identified TD corpora characteristics 
   as well as an inventory of those which are accessible online.
